Hi there! My name is Meena. I'm interested in AI safety, governance, and policy.

I'm currently at McKinsey, where I have worked with a range of private and public sector clients on topics related to [Generative AI](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai), AI/ML transformations, [early product development](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/labs), growth strategy, and change management. 

Prior to McKinsey, I spent most of my time exploring the intersection between computer science, policy, and analytics, including fellowships with the U.S. Department of State, Federal Trade Commission, working with the Analytics Team on the Biden for President campaign. 

I graduated from Georgetown University with a B.S.F.S in international politics, computer science, and russian. At Georgetown, I was a Fritz Tech & Society Fellow and worked with the Massive Data Institute to research [misinformation themes during the 2020 presidential election](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/research-note-lies-and-presidential-debates-how-political-misinformation-spread-across-media-streams-during-the-2020-election/).

I like learning languages. I'm fluent in Tamil, at one point was had professional working proficiency in Russian, and am working on my French and Hindi. I am an avid Kindle-user, like long runs in nature, and writing music.
